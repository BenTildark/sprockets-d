# Handling errors 9

"""
Only two errors here, another Unresolved reference 'Handling'( I think its looking for a class Handling ) Interesting the
semicolon precceding the first-letter H doesn't change the error.. In breif, this shows us the importantance of correct formating.
Then another Unresolved reference error, clearly it's a simple typo & you forgot to put it in a string. I learned from
this writing consistent code is important always downcase & underscore R da rules, data starts with a capital should be in
a string or an initalized class object.
