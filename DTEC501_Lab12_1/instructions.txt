This page has been included as a reminder of what code needs to be submitted and what code must not be submitted.

You will create a function as your answer to each question in this assessment.  It is important to only submit the code for your function.



Examples.


Write a function which returns a value.
If the question says to create a function called times_two which returns double the value that was passed to the
function then the function below is the correct one to use.

def times_two(value):
#  The function returns double the value it receives

    multiplier = 2
    product = value * multiplier
    return product



To test your code you could write the following code

print(times_two(2))
4

print(times_two(3))
6

print(times_two(5))
10



It is important that you only paste the function code to Moodle so in this case, only submit the following:



def times_two(value):
#  The function returns double the value it receives

    multiplier = 2
    product = value * multiplier
    return product



Write a function which prints a message.
If the question says to create a function called add_two which prints the value that was passed to the
function plus 2 in a suitable message then the function below is the correct one to use.

def add_two(value):
#     The function prints the value received + 2

    two = 2
    total = value + two
    print("{} + {} = {}".format(value, two,total))
    return



This can be tested as follows.

add_two(2)
2 + 2 = 4

add_two(4)
4 + 2 = 6

It is important that you only paste the function code to Moodle so in this case, only submit the following:

def add_two(value):
#     The function prints the value received + 2

    two = 2
    total = value + two
    print("{} + {} = {}".format(value, two,total))
    return
